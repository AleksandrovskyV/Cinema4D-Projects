![preview](../!ALL-PREVIEW/Arnold_String-Path_Randomizer_Selector.gif)

Created to automate workflows with Substance Painter (which is why specific texture pass names are used).

Key Features
🎲 Randomizes Arnold textures from a selected folder  
🎯 Allows manual selection of a specific Arnold texture from the folder  

📝 Notes  
* Texture filenames must be numbered sequentially — use Adobe Bridge or similar tools for batch renaming
* Your custom mesh objects must contain the required User Data, included as a preset in the project

To set it up:
Create a new object
Go to User Data > Add User Data > Load Preset (ARND_STRING_ATR) > OK
Copy the yellow Xpresso tag to your object
